# Summer Olympics

The Summer Olympic Games, often called the "Olympics," are a major international multi-sport event held every four years. Organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), they feature a wide range of sports and disciplines, drawing athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level.
The modern Summer Olympics were first held in 1896 in Athens, Greece. They were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games that took place in Olympia, Greece, from around 776 BC to 393 AD. Pierre de Coubertin revived the modern Games.
This task only affects individual sports with mixed participants (male/female). All athletes are fictional and have no relation to actual athletes.
